# GPU-Accelerated-Keyword-Search-in-Binary-Tree
GPU-accelerated keyword search in a full binary tree using CUDA. Synthetic fixed-length word database stored in array heap layout with power-of-two leaf enforcement. Implements CPU baseline, single-keyword GPU kernel (one thread per leaf), and optimized multi-keyword parallel search with atomic synchronization and benchmarking.
